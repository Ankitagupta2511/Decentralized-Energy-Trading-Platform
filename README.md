# Decentralized Energy Trading Platform

## Project Description

The Decentralized Energy Trading Platform is a revolutionary blockchain-based marketplace that enables peer-to-peer energy trading between renewable energy producers and consumers. Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, this platform allows individuals and businesses with solar panels, wind turbines, or other renewable energy sources to sell excess energy directly to their neighbors and local community members.

By eliminating traditional energy intermediaries, the platform creates a more efficient, transparent, and democratic energy market where pricing is determined by supply and demand dynamics. The system promotes renewable energy adoption, reduces energy costs for consumers, and provides additional income streams for energy producers.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a sustainable, decentralized energy ecosystem that empowers communities to become energy-independent and accelerates the transition to renewable energy. We aim to:

- *Democratize Energy Markets*: Enable anyone to become an energy trader, breaking monopolies of traditional utility companies
- *Accelerate Renewable Adoption*: Provide economic incentives for individuals to invest in renewable energy systems
- *Reduce Energy Costs*: Create competitive pricing through direct peer-to-peer transactions
- *Build Energy Communities*: Foster local energy resilience and community cooperation
- *Promote Sustainability*: Support the global transition to clean, renewable energy sources
- *Enable Energy Independence*: Reduce reliance on centralized power grids and fossil fuels

registerUser("Solar Farm Owner", "California, USA");

// List energy for sale (after verification)
listEnergy(1000, 50000000000000000, "California", "Solar"); // 1000 kWh at 0.05 ETH per kWh


#### For Energy Consumers:
solidity
// Register as a user
registerUser("Green Consumer", "California, USA");

// Purchase energy from listing ID 1
purchaseEnergy(1, 500); // Buy 500 kWh from listing 1
